"I wanna heal <br>
I wanna feel <br>
What I thought was never real <br>
I want to let go of the pain I felt so long <br>
Erase all the pain till it's gone <br>
I wanna heal <br>
I wanna feel <br>
Like I'm close to something real <br>
I want to find something I've wanted all along <br>
Somewhere I belong"
